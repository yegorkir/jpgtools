# GitHub Pages auto-deploy on main push

## Summary
- Added a GitHub Actions workflow to publish `docs/` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

## Notes
- The workflow uses the official Pages actions and requires Pages to be enabled in repository settings.

## Verification
- Push to `main` and confirm the Pages deployment succeeds.
